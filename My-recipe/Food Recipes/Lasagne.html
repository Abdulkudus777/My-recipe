        <p>What's our secret to our best lasagne recipe?<br>
            There are many good reasons this particular lasagne recipe has become so beloved. The addition of wine in the meat sauce makes it super flavourful, while the layering of pasta (or 'lasagna noodles' for those in the US!) with mozzarella makes for the perfect 'cheese pull moment' (watch our video to witness it in action). But if we were to pick one thing that makes this lasagne recipe stand out above all others, it’s the luscious bechamel. A good homemade bechamel base or 'cheese sauce' takes time, but it’s worth it for the extra depth of flavour it brings.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Beef mince: </b>  it would hardly be a classic family favourite lasagne without a rich, ground beef mince sauce. Beef mince is ideal for bulking up a lasagne and adding protein to the dish. Our Recipes Editor Sonya Gellert has also made this recipe using plant-based mince, and declared it a delicious success.</li>
        <li><b>Italian diced tomatoes:</b> a double duty ingredient, Italian diced tomatoes bring both moisture and added flavour to your meat sauce. We love how this simple pantry staple does so much heavy lifting in this recipe.</li>
        <li><b>Tomato paste: </b> while we use lots of simple ingredients to bring flavour to this recipe (think onion, garlic, a splash of dry red wine and seasonings), for us tomato paste is a non-negotiable. It's an instant umami-bomb and a little goes a long way.</li>
        <li><b>Fresh lasagne sheets:</b> we think fresh is best when it comes to lasagne sheets, but if you only have dried lasagne sheets, you can pre-cook your pasta sheets to soften them (following packet directions) before cooking. This will ensure your pasta isn't raw and crunchy. In our recipe notes, we have suggestions for other layers you can use instead of pasta too.</li>
        <li><b>Mozzarella: </b>  what would a baked lasagne be without the golden brown top and cheesy pull? We use a dry mozzarella (and coarsely grate a block), rather than fresh, wetter mozzarella, to ensure that magic pull moment and a signature, alluring topping.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b><br>
            Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until onion softens. Add the mince and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up any lumps, for 5 minutes or until mince changes colour. Add the tomato, wine and tomato paste, and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b><br>
            Meanwhile, to make the cheese sauce, combine the milk, onion , parsley stalks, peppercorns, cloves and bay leaves in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside for 15 minutes to infuse.</li>
         <li><b>Step 3</b><br>
            Strain the milk mixture through a fine sieve into a large jug. Discard solids.</li>
            <li><b>Step 4</b><br>
                Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes or until mixture bubbles and begins to come away from the side of the pan. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li><b>Step 5</b><br>
                Gradually pour in half the milk, whisking constantly with a balloon whisk, until mixture is smooth. Gradually add the remaining milk, whisking until smooth and combined.</li>
