        <p>What makes this our best fried rice recipe?<br>
            In this super simple egg fried rice recipe we use pantry and fridge staples, but the beauty of basic fried rice recipes is that you can always adjust the ingredients based on what you happen to have on hand at any given time.
            The real secret here is to use a large fry pan or wok on a very high heat so the rice is fried and golden, rather than steamed or gluggy. Cooking it this way ensures the fried rice still has bite and absorbs the lovely flavours of the bacon and soy, without resembling a risotto!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>White, long grain rice.</b> Your fried rice will turn out best if you use cold, long-grain rice (like jasmine rice). It's really important to properly cool the rice down so if you're in a rush and just cooked the rice, spread it thinly on a tray, cover loosely with some cling wrap and pop in the fridge until cool.</li>
        <li><b>Soy sauce.</b> We usually use whatever soy sauce is on hand, but of course you can use gluten-free soy sauce (tamari) or low-sodium soy sauce instead and still create a flavourful fried rice.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b> We form an omelette with the eggs to mix through our fried rice, but you could always create a scrambled eggs texture, if you prefer.</li>
        <li><b>Carrot:</b> Adds colour and texture. We prefer grated or very finely julienned in this recipe.</li>
        <li><b>Peas:</b> frozen peas that have been thawed beforehand works best.</li>
        <li><b>Bacon:</b> While we do think the bacon really helps the flavours in this dish, if you don't have it to hand, we have used ham as an alternative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b><br>
            Cook the rice in a large saucepan of boiling water for 12 minutes or until tender. Drain and leave to cool.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b><br>
            Heat oil in non-stick wok or large frying pan over medium heat. Add eggs. Swirl over base to form an omelette. Cook for 2 minutes or until set. Transfer to a chopping board. Set aside to cool slightly. Roll up and thickly slice.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b><br>
            Add bacon to wok. Cook 4 minutes until light golden. Add carrot. Stir fry 1 minute. Add shallots, peas and rice. Cook, stirring, 3-4 minutes. Add egg and soy sauce. Stir until heated through. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and top with extra shallots. Serve immediately.</li>
